# Social_Network_API

## Description
This project is created to showcase MongoDB and how to apply our skills. This database differs form MySql is that MongoDB is use unstructured data unlike MySql that would use tables. Mongoose
allows us to use schema in our MongoDB database which makes it sort of act like MySql. We have the same folder layout as we do with previous works so it wasn't that much harder than other works.
